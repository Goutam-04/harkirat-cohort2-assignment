debouncing :- delaying sending out in request eg. amazon search bar , for that we use settimeout with the

why do a react component should return a single child like <>components..</>
because it makes easy to do reconsilation:- dom to know which component to update
memo: skips a re-render if the comoonents prop dont change
key: key is important to lessen the re-render in map function by using a uniqe key for every component
wrapper component: is a type to pass a component as prop inside another component

side effects and their example
bind and this keyword in js
use callback, usememo
why we have custom hooks why dont we use functions? cuz we dont use states inside a function but only in hooks and components

react-router-dom
react.lazy
children thing
